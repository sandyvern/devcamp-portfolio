        <p>Hi, I'm Sandy Hogan - a mostly self-taught web developer who is always excited to be learning about "All Things Coding". 
        I'm currently enrolled at <a href="https://flatironschool.com" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>, with the goal of completing 
        their online Full Stack Web Development program. 
        I've also spent a lot of time learning on platforms such as <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> and <a href='https://udemy.com' target='_blank'>Udemy</a>. 
        Before enrolling at Flatiron School, I worked my way through a few different Blueprints from <a href="https://skillcrush.com" target="_blank">Skillcrush</a>
        which got me in the habit of coding and taught me some important skills about 'learning how to learn.' I've also spent plenty of time checking out pretty much every online learn-to-code site I hear about from fellow learners.
        </p>
        <p>While learning to code and diving into web development, I have continued to work full-time running my own 
        pet sitting company, <a href="https://pawprints-n-hoofbeats.com" target="_blank"P>Pawprints & HoofBeats</a>, as well as, working part-time as an Office Administration at my church. My business website has been my long-time playground for 
        experimenting with learning to code for the past 12 years that I have been in business.
        </p>
        <p>I have an Associates degree in Applied Animal Science from the Thompson School of Applied Sciences, 
        at the University of New Hampshire. I would love to somehow be able join my 2 passions; animals and coding, 
        to create web applications that would help animal related businesses, such as veterinarians, pet care providers, 
        shelters and rescue organizations provide professional web development and design services to their communities and animal charges.</p>
